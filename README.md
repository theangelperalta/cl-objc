## CL-OBJC - ðŸš§ UNDER CONSTRUCTION ðŸš§
---
CL-OBJC is a portable common-lisp/objective-c bridge written using CFFI. The aim is to be able to build Cocoa applications on macOS to design the GUI and then implement the code in common-lisp. (This my attempt to revive this project).


## Examples
### Hello World
![example_screenshot](/doc/screenshots/hello_example.gif)

I have one of the three original examples up running. A simple window with buttons that bind to CL methods. The entire application is written in Objective-C no InterfaceBuilder used.

### Converter

One of the orignal macOS app tutorials convert to CL again completely built in Objective-C, no interface builder!
