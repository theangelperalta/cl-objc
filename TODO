* Optimization: Specialize on expand-{to/from}-foreign instead of translate-{to/from}-foreign

* Generate at runtime C glue code to solve the struct-by-value problem. Better solution: just a function for each struct. See the bridgesupport and cffi-grovel projects

* Define a variadic defun to call objc methods instead of having a variadic macro (see segv suggestions)

* Update the docs to make it document each exported function, add a tutorial on the clos interface and a makefile to generate the doc (using sb-texinfo)

* Add more examples (one using the clos interface)

* Feature: struct definition Caching

* BugFix: Allow the working of cl-objc on a read-only installation (i.e. without framework caching)

* Search for the framework cache also in another location (useful for the deploy of ready-to-use application)

* Feature: Complete the ObjC CLOS interface

* Feature: Support for the call to super

* Feature: Make ensure-objc-class try to add the ivars to a class if the definition is the same as previous

* Feature: Add an objc-let* macro

* Use cl-launch for the examples

* Check if cl-objc works with variadic methods

* Remove warnings in test suite :runtime and in with-ivar-accessors

* Refactoring: Use aif and split-sequence when possible

* Remove functions wrapping defcfuns just to save docstrings (outdated feature by last CFFI version)

* Feature: Protocol management

* Feature: Exception management
