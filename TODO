* Bugfix
** Allow the working of cl-objc on a read-only installation (i.e. without framework caching)

** CLOS Definitions per framework. Actually we can't distinguish where methods/classes come from if we force the generation of clos definitions

** Support for Variadic ObjC methods

** Remove warnings in test suite :runtime and in with-ivar-accessors

** Remove unused functions

** See the KNOWN_BUGS file for the WONTFIX bugs

* Docs & Examples
** Update the docs to make it document each exported function, add a tutorial on the clos interface and a makefile to generate the doc (using sb-texinfo)

** Add more examples (one using the clos interface)

** Use cl-launch for the examples

* New minor features

** Make ensure-objc-class try to add the ivars to a class if the definition is the same as previous

** Add an objc-let* macro

** README file

** Better error signaling if wrong input to functions is passed

** Makes objc reader produce objects that can be handled with the clos interface

* New major features

** Define a variadic defun to call foreign functions instead of using a variadic macro

** Complete the ObjC CLOS interface (objc ivars in slots, mixed slots, defmethod mixed)

** Support for the call to super

** Protocol management

** Exception management

** Easy Deploy feature

** Integration with XCode
